# Socket-Programming

Implemented a communication protocol in python
This project involves two sections:
<ol>
<li>One involves the basic interactions between the edge device (i.e., the client)
and the central server and includes functionality for edge devices to communicate with the central
server via TCP.</li>
<li>The second involves an additional functionality
whereby two edge devices can exchange video files with one another directly in a peer-to-peer fashion
via UDP.</li>
</ol>
